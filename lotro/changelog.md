# Skynet's Amazing Changelog, or something like that
## Current version: 0.1.4

### ver 0.1.4
Tired of dark themes? Switch to light theme with just one click! Toggle between light and dark themes at your leisure. Themes are saved using a browser cookie. Nom! 
Also removed the weird space in lineup copies. 

### ver 0.1.3
The copyKitty arrives! No longer do you have to manually type in a lineup, now you can simply copy it with the click of a button! 

### ver 0.1.2
Leaves spaces for slots and roles that a player does not have. I was going to do that for classes too, but nah, I think it's fine. 
Lineups now filter by class for main tank, off tank, LM, burg and red cappy dropdowns. 
Added an alert to tell users they've put the same person in the same lineup twice (or more). 

### ver 0.1.1
Changing people in the dropdowns causes the list of alternates for each day to update. 

### ver 0.1.0
The sorting hat now sorts dropdowns by role and timeslot. That means no more putting your poor dps-only player into a tank role. 

### ver 0.0.2
The sorting hat now has a cool dark theme and is no longer boring white!

### ver 0.0.1
So hi here we are, the amazing sorting hat has been LAUNCHED!!!!!! It is THE antidote for our wonderful headaches when creating lineups. May we suffer noevermore.
